# CLAUDE.md

This file is a redirect for Claude Code. **Do not add documentation here.**

**`AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth** for all project documentation, build commands, architecture, CI, and code style guidelines. You MUST read it at the start of every task. All documentation updates go there, never here.
